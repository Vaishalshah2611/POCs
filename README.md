# POCs

Project 1: 
ELK stack is deployed to make a one-stop solution for monitoring and logging management. ELK stack is deployed using various DevOps technologies. Tech Stack contains; Terraform, Docker, Ansible, GitHub, AWS cloud, and CI/CD. I have used these tools to take the benefits of each technology and make it easier for tech savvies to deploy monitoring and logging infrastructure.

Project 2: 
AWS-EKS is created using terraform.And, setup of a web-application and with MongoDB database over the Kubernetes cluster. 

Project 3: 
In this Project, I have created monitoring and visualizing infrastructure for EKS resources. Grafana and Prometheus are used for the setup. Along with it, Slack is integrated with Grafana. So, when an event hits a threshold configured, Grafana sends an alert message in the Slack channel.

Project 4: 
Horizontal Pod Autoscaling is configured in AWS-EKS. So that Pod can scale in real time according to in coming traffic load

Project 5: 
AWS-EKS is created using Terraform and Cluster Autoscaler is configured in order to combat the stress on application by adjusting the number nodes running in the cluster.

Project 6:
In this project, Amazon QuickSight is configured to visualize the data of Amazon RDS MS-SQL Server in a secure way.
