# POCs

Project-1: 
ELK stack is deployed to make a one-stop solution for monitoring and logging management. ELK stack is deployed using various DevOps technologies. Tech Stack contains; Terraform, Docker, Ansible, GitHub, AWS cloud, and CI/CD. I have used these tools to take the benefits of each technology and make it easier for tech savvies to deploy monitoring and logging infrastructure.

Project-2: 
AWS-EKS is created using terraform.And, setup of a web-application and with MongoDB database over the Kubernetes cluster. 

Project-3: 
In this Project, I have created monitoring and visualizing infrastructure for EKS resources. Grafana and Prometheus are used for the setup. Along with it, Slack is integrated with Grafana. So, when an event hits a threshold configured, Grafana sends an alert message in the Slack channel.

Project-4: 
Horizontal Pod Autoscaling is configured in AWS-EKS. So that Pod can scale in real time according to in coming traffic load

Project-5: 
AWS-EKS is created using Terraform and Cluster Autoscaler is configured in order to combat the stress on application by adjusting the number nodes running in the cluster.

Project-6:
In this project, Amazon QuickSight is configured to visualize the data of Amazon RDS MS-SQL Server in a secure way.

Project-7: In this project, AWS services SNS and SQS are used. In which, messages are "pushed" to multiple subscribers, which eliminates the need to periodically check or poll for updates and enables parallel asynchronous processing of the message by the subscribers.

Project-8: In this project, a Continuous Delivery pipeline is created in AWS. Services such as AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild and Elastic BeanStalk are use for the demo purpose.
